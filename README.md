# Bookshelf Apps

**Bookshelf Apps** is a bookshelf management web application. This website has a function similar to the To-Do web application. The features of Bookshelf Apps are:

- **Adding books**: Users can add new books to the existing shelf (**Unread** or **Already Read**).
- **Moving books**: Users can move books between the **Unread** shelf to the **Already Read** shelf, and vice versa.
- **Deleting books**: Users can delete books from an existing shelf.
- **Reset bookshelf**: Users can reset or delete all books from all bookshelves.
- **Search for books**: Users can search for books through the search field provided. This search uses the wilcard searching technique, so that users can search more easily without needing to pay attention to the characters before or after the keyword given.
- **Delete confirmation dialog**: Users will be asked again when they want to delete a book or reset the bookshelf. This is done to minimize potential errors caused by user inadvertence in using this web application.
- **Responsive design**: The layout of this website application has been made responsive, which means that users can access it through various devices (desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile).

Bookshelf Apps stores all the user's book data in `localStorage`, so even if the browser is closed the book data remains when it is reopened.
